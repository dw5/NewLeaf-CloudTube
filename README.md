NewLeaf is a YouTube data extractor, compatible with the Invidious API.

NewLeaf has no frontend. It is intended to be used in combination with
a frontend like [CloudTube](https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/cloudtube).

NewLeaf uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to assist with
data extraction, but also does some extraction itself.
