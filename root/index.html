    <h1>NewLeaf</h1>
    <p>You've reached a NewLeaf instance.</p>
    <p>NewLeaf is a YouTube data extractor, compatible with Invidious.</p>
    <h2>If you do heavy data scraping</h2>
    <p>Please do <i>not</i> scrape from public instances!</p>
    <p>Public instances are run by volunteers who really do not need to deal with your crap.</p>
    <p>You can run your own copy of NewLeaf very easily. It'll benefit us by not flooding us with requests. It'll also benefit you: your application will speed up since it won't be drowned out by all the other people who ignored this warning and started spamming us anyway.</p>
    <p>For more information, please get in touch. I'm happy to help you if you need to learn how to not abuse other people's work.</p>
